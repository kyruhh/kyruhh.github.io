# Taylor's Version Concept, Explained

To put it simply, (Taylor's Version) is all about Taylor Swift taking back ownership of her songs. This means she can call the shots on where to use it and collect the money they make. Now, Taylor originally didn't own her first six albums â€” her self-titled debut album, Fearless, Speak Now, Red, 1989, and Reputation, since it was stolen by Scooter Braun. She re-records these stolen albums so that she can own the music thaty she created, along with releasing *Vault Tracks* (songs that she created in that specific album but didn't release it)
