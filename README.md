Taylor Alison Swift, also known as Taylor Swift, is a 33-year old singer who was born at December 13, 1989. She started her music career at the young age of 16, when she released her very first album called [Debut](https://open.spotify.com/album/5eyZZoQEFQWRHkV2xgAeBw?si=sn_EPjX2TrmWWWldPfHB6g), which was released at October 24, 2006. 

### Taylor's Version Concept, Explained

To put it simply, (Taylor's Version) is all about Taylor Swift taking back ownership of her songs. This means she can call the shots on where to use it and collect the money they make. Now, Taylor originally didn't own her first six albums â€” her self-titled debut album, Fearless, Speak Now, Red, 1989, and Reputation, since it was stolen by Scooter Braun. She re-records these stolen albums so that she can own the music thaty she created, along with releasing *Vault Tracks* (songs that she created in that specific album but didn't release it)

### The Eras Tour
She created 10 Albums which she calls *Eras*. These 10 eras are basically Debut, Fearless, Speak Now, Red, 1989, Reputation, Lover, Folklore, Evermore, and lastly, Midnights. She has this show called The Eras Tour, which started at Glendale, Arizona, at March 17, 2023. At this show, she performs songs from all of the 10 eras.

The tour had a significant cultural, economic and political impact, evident in the form of unprecedented demand, ticket sales, venue attendance records, and technical obstacles that led to imposition of price regulation and anti-scalping laws; elevated economies, businesses, and tourism; domination of news cycles and social media; and tributes from governments and organizations. Ticketmaster, an official partner, was scrutinized for ineffective sales and alleged monopoly. The tour pushed Swift's net worth over US$1 billion, making her the first billionaire ever with music as the main source of income.

Swift announced and released various works during the tour: extended editions of Midnights, the re-recorded albums Speak Now (Taylor's Version) and 1989 (Taylor's Version), the music videos for "Karma" and "I Can See You", and "Cruel Summer" as a single. An accompanying concert film was released to theaters worldwide on October 13, 2023, and became the highest-grossing concert film in history.

### The Eras Tour Movie
She released minimal international dates for The Eras Tour. Because of this, International Swifties are devastated since they won't get a chance to see Taylor and watch her show. Because of this, she thought about releasing The Eras Tour Movie worldwide so that everyone can enjoy. She released the movie last October 13, 2023 on all cinemas.
